User triggers sync (manual or scheduled)\n2. Browser opens with persistent session\n3. First time: user signs into YouTube manually\n4. App navigates to history page\n5. Scrolls and extracts until reaching last synced entry\n6. Returns extracted data for storage\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Playwright launches with persistent user data\n- [ ] Successfully navigates to YouTube history page\n- [ ] User login session persists across app launches\n- [ ] Incremental fetch stops at last synced entry\n- [ ] Handles scroll loading for more entries","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"janghwan@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T14:57:14.130836+09:00","created_by":"Kim, Jang-hwan (김장환)","updated_at":"2026-01-31T14:59:16.689937+09:00"}
